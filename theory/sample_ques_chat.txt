Short Answer Questions
12. Explain how an MQTT broker manages communication between clients.
Answer: An MQTT broker receives messages from publishers and forwards them to subscribers based on topics. It ensures efficient message delivery with low bandwidth requirements.

What role does LoRaWAN play in IoT communication?
Answer: LoRaWAN is a network protocol that enables long-range, low-power communication for IoT devices using LoRa technology.

Describe the difference between MQTT and HTTP in terms of IoT communication.
Answer: MQTT is lightweight and optimized for low-bandwidth, real-time communication, while HTTP is heavier and typically used for web-based applications.

How does an Arduino Uno interact with sensors in an IoT system?
Answer: The Arduino Uno reads data from sensors via its GPIO pins and processes or transmits the data over serial or network communication protocols.

Why is low power consumption important for IoT devices?
Answer: IoT devices are often deployed in remote locations and rely on batteries, making power efficiency critical for long-term operation.

What is the main purpose of an actuator in an IoT system?
Answer: Actuators perform actions based on signals received from IoT devices, such as turning on a motor or opening a valve.

How does a publish-subscribe model differ from a client-server model?
Answer: The publish-subscribe model allows multiple devices to receive messages based on topics, while a client-server model requires direct communication between two entities.

What is the function of an IoT gateway?
Answer: An IoT gateway connects IoT devices to the cloud by managing data transmission, security, and protocol translation.
